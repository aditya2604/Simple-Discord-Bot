# Simple-Discord-Bot

**Setup**:

1. Install Python 3.5 or higher (if you don't already have it)

2. Go [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me) and set up an application. Click the button to give it a bot account, and copy the token into the file 'config.json'

3. Put the bot's response, and the words it should respond to in config.json

4. Run the bot (you can do this by typing 'python3 SimpleModBot.py' in command prompt). It will provide a link in the console to invite the bot to your server. 

5. Visit the discord py. [api](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) documentation to learn more about programming a bot.
